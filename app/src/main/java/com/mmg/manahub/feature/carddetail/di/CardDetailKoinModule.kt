/**
 * KMP migration — Phase 1 Hilt→Koin cutover. The Card Detail feature is the eighth "Koin island":
 * [CardDetailViewModel] is resolved by Koin (`koinViewModel()`) while every other un-migrated feature
 * stays on Hilt. This continues the incremental, per-feature cutover proven by Spike D (after Settings,
 * Stats, Profile, Home, TagDictionary, AddCard and CommunityDecks).
 *
 * ## Bridge pattern (same as the earlier islands)
 * [CardDetailViewModel] depends on twelve constructor arguments. The `SavedStateHandle` is supplied by
 * Koin itself; the other eleven are singletons still owned by the Hilt object graph. Rather than
 * re-providing them in Koin — which would risk duplicate construction / divergent state — `ManaHubApp`
 * is the bridge: it `@Inject`s the already-constructed Hilt instances and passes the CardDetail-only
 * ones into [cardDetailKoinModule], which re-exposes them to Koin as `single { }`.
 *
 * `savedStateHandle = get()` resolves the Koin-injected [androidx.lifecycle.SavedStateHandle] that
 * carries the `scryfallId` nav arg (the CommunityDeckDetail precedent — `koinViewModel()` reads it from
 * the `NavBackStackEntry` `CreationExtras`), so the nav-arg behaviour is identical to the previous Hilt
 * resolution.
 *
 * Six of the eleven Hilt-owned dependencies are SHARED with other islands and are therefore NOT
 * registered here — they are bridged exactly once in `coreBridgeKoinModule` (registering the same type
 * in two loaded modules would throw `DefinitionOverrideException`) and resolved below via `get()`:
 * - `CardRepository` — shared with Home + CommunityDecks.
 * - `DeckRepository` — shared with Stats + Home + CommunityDecks.
 * - `UserPreferencesRepository` — shared with Settings + Stats.
 * - `UserPreferencesDataStore` — shared with Settings + Profile + Home + CommunityDecks.
 * - `AuthRepository` — shared with Settings + Profile + Home.
 * - `AnalyticsHelper` — shared with Settings (PROMOTED into `coreBridgeKoinModule` for this island —
 *   it was previously a Settings-only bridged singleton; Settings was shrunk to resolve it via `get()`).
 *
 * `WishlistRepository` and `OpenForTradeRepository` are both bridged in `coreBridgeKoinModule` (shared
 * with the Trades island, which PROMOTED them — `WishlistRepository` was previously a Home `single`,
 * `OpenForTradeRepository` a CardDetail `single` here until then). They are therefore NOT registered here
 * — registering the same type in two loaded modules would throw `DefinitionOverrideException` — and are
 * resolved below via `get()`.
 *
 * The remaining [Module] params are the CardDetail-only bridged singletons consumed by no other Koin
 * island (`UserCardRepository` is also resolved via `get()` by the Trades island — leaving it here is
 * fine, a `single<T>` is resolvable from any loaded module).
 *
 * As features migrate further in Phase 1, each `single { hiltInstance }` here is replaced by a real Koin
 * provider and the matching Hilt `@Provides`/`@Binds` is deleted — so the bridge shrinks to nothing
 * without ever leaving the app uncompilable between commits.
 *
 * @param userCardRepository the Hilt-owned [UserCardRepository] singleton (CardDetail + Trades-via-get()).
 * @param addToCollection the Hilt-owned [AddCardToCollectionUseCase] singleton (this island only).
 * @param addToWishlistUseCase the Hilt-owned [AddToWishlistUseCase] singleton (this island only).
 * @return a Koin [Module] that provides the CardDetail-only bridged singletons and the
 *   [CardDetailViewModel] factory.
